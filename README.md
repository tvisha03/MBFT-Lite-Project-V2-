ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
<br>
<b>MBFT-Lite (Modified Multi-Branch Federated Transformer)</b> 
<br>
It is a privacy-preserving phishing email detection framework that combines the power of deep learning and federated learning. It uses TinyBERT to analyze the semantic content of emails and XGBoost to extract insights from metadata features, enabling accurate classification without sharing raw data. The system simulates training across multiple clients using real-world email datasets and employs fusion strategies (weighted averaging, max-confidence voting, meta-classifier) to enhance final prediction accuracy. MBFT-Lite is designed for scalability, privacy compliance, and strong generalization to unseen phishing threats.
